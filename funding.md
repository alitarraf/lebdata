and effort for the greater good, but also by funding bodies and partners who
have been supporting the organisation since its early days. On this page, we
acknowledge institutions who supported LebData in terms of:

* *direct funding*: these funders support LebData through direct donations to the
  organisation

* *indirect funding*: these funders support LebData through means other than
  direct donations, typically through salaries of members who contribute to
  LebData activities through their professional activity, or financial support of
  events
  
* *partners*: these are organisations which have been collaborating with LebData
  to share technology and data, co-organise events such as workshops and short courses
