<p><a href="https://github.com/reconhub/outbreaker2"><em>outbreaker2</em></a> is a total re-implementation of a model implemented in
 <a href="https://github.com/thibautjombart/outbreaker"><em>outbreaker</em></a>, for the
 reconstruction of transmission trees from densely sampled outbreaks (i.e., most
 cases observed). While the original version was computationally efficient, it
 basically consisted of a C engine which was optimized for speed, but poorly
 tested (no unit testing) and very hard to develop upon.</p>

<p>This is unfortunate, as the <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003457">original
model</a>
was fairly simple and did not allow addition of new types of data or likelihood
components. The original idea behind <em>outbreaker2</em> was to address these
limitations.</p>

<p>The major novelty of <em>outbreaker2</em> is flexibility. The design of <em>outbreaker2</em>
relied on breaking down the components making up <em>outbreaker</em> and similar
methods, and treating them as separate modules. This includes priors,
likekelihood functions, and even movement of parameters and augmented data. All
of these modules are treated as separate ingredients of a big methodological
recipe, and <em>outbreaker2</em> provides the cooking pot.</p>

<p><a><img src="/img/posts/cookingpot.png" alt="outbreaker2 cooking pot" /></a></p>

<p>In fact, it also provides the kitchen, as it implements an infrastructure for
handling data, defining settings of the method, and customising functions for
priors, likelihoods, and random walks in the parameter space. This gives the
user more control over the analysis, but will also drastically facilitate the
development of new models without risking to break the existing
infrastructure. Even if the components of the default <em>outbreaker2</em> model all
runs in C++ (integrated via Rcpp), users can specify new components of the model
as R functions, tapping the C++ API where relevant.</p>

<h3 id="towards-more-reliability">Towards more reliability</h3>

<p>Another side-benefit of this modularity is making testing simpler. Like most if
not all similar methods in the field, <em>outbreaker</em> had no unit testing. Not
one. Nothing. <em>outbreaker2</em> will follow the standards defined by
<a href="http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/">RECON</a> for package development, including
complete coverage of the code (in R as well as C++) by unit testing (current
<a href="https://codecov.io/github/reconhub/outbreaker2?branch=master">coverage</a> is
about 70%) and the use of continuous integration tools (currently Travis and
Appveyor).</p>

<h3 id="slower-but-better">Slower, but better</h3>

<p><em>outbreaker2</em> is slower than <em>outbreaker</em> by about one order of magnitude, but
 speed can be deceptive. While the flexibility acquired in <em>outbreaker2</em>
 undoubtedly has a cost in terms of speed, <em>outbreaker2</em> also does considerably
 more per iteration of the MCMC than its predecessor. For instance, only a
 fraction of the transmission tree was altered (‚Äúmoved‚Äù) at each MCMC iteration
 in <em>outbreaker</em>. The same was true of dates of infections, and some other
 movements. In contrast, <em>outbreaker2</em> everything that can be moved at each
 iteration, resulting in faster mixing. It may be 12 times slower, but it mixes
 approximately 10 times faster, so that the speed difference is not as bad as it
 seems.</p>
