<p>The <strong>R</strong> <strong>E</strong>pidemics <strong>Con</strong>sortium (RECON) is an international
not-for-profit, <strong>non-governmental organisation</strong> gathering experts in data
science, modelling methodology, public health, and software development to
create the next generation of analytics tools for informing the response
to <em>disease outbreaks</em>, <em>health emergencies</em> and <em>humanitarian crises</em>, 
using the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R software</a> and other free, 
open-source resources.</p>

<p>This includes packages specifically designed for handling, visualising, and
analysing outbreak data using cutting-edge statistical methods, as well as more
general-purpose tools for data cleaning, versioning, and encryption, and system
infrastructure.</p>

<p>Our packages must fulfil three key aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Efficiency</em>: our tools can be used in real time to improve situation
awareness and inform intervention strategies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Reliability</em>: our tools are thoroughly and constantly tested using
professional software development methods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Accessibility</em>: our tools are free, open-source, and available on virtually
any platform; they can be used with different levels of expertise, and aim to
provide graphical user interfaces implementing the most important
functionalities.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Besides its active involvement in the creation of tools, RECON is also
increasingly dedicated to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>disseminating knowledge</em>: RECON provides free, open-access training material
 on its training platform <a href="https://reconlearn.org">reconlearn.org</a>, and
 regularly organises workshops and short courses on outbreak analytics and
 data science. Our <a href="/forum">public forum </a>, freely accessible to anyone, is
 dedicated to sharing exptertise on these topics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>outbreak response deployment</em>: RECON supports the deployment of data
 analytics resources to the field as part of the response to health
 emergencies; this includes the deployment of staff as well as analysis
 systems adapted to low resources settings.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><br /> As of 19th September 2018, RECON is registered as a <em>not-for-profit</em>,
<em>incorporated association</em> regulated by the French law (registration number
W751246083), in accordance to the association law of 1st July 1901 and the
decree of the 16th August 1901. For more information about the remit of RECON,
