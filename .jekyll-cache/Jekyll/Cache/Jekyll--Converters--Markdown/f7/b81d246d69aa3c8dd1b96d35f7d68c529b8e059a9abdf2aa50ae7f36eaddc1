I"ó<p>Only four months ago, the R Epidemics Consortium was posting its <a href="http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/2016-09-06-new-sections/">birth certificate</a> online. Since then, our project has received considerable enthusiasm from the community, and we have been lucky to be joined by some truly amazing people. And the list is growing, still.</p>

<p>Many projects have emerged in our four months of existence, and a lot of exciting things are coming. In no specific order, our 2017 good resolutions include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>release core packages for outbreak response, including: contact data (<em>epicontacts</em>), delay estimation (<em>distcrete</em>), outbreak reconstruction (<em>outbreaker2</em>), data encryption (<em>cyphr</em>), compartmental models (<em>odin</em>), and more</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>develop new methods and tools for foodborne outbreak detection from genomic surveillance data (see <a href="http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/2016-12-16-new-job/">this job ad</a>)</p>
