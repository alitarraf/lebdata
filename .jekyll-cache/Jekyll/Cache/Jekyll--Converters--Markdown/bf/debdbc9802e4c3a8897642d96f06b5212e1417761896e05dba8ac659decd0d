<ul>
  <li>a toolkit for computing, handling, and plotting incidence</li>
  <li>a set of functions for fitting log-linear models to incidence data</li>
  <li>a tool for detecting the peak of an outbreak based on log-linear model fitting</li>
  <li>a tool for computing doubling or halving times using log-linear models</li>
  <li>a package including 3 vignettes: an overview of features (<em>overview</em>), tips for customizing plots (<em>customize-plot</em>) and details of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">incidence</code> class (<em>incidence-class</em>)</li>
  <li>a thoroughly-tested set of functions (code coverage by unit tests: <a href="http://codecov.io/github/reconhub/incidence?branch=master">100%</a>)</li>
</ul>
