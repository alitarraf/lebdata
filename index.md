The data we publish on LebData must meet the following criteria:
- *Verifiability*:  means other people using LebData can check that the information comes from a [reliable source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#What_counts_as_a_reliable_source).

- *Accessibility*: the data is free, open-source, public and available on virtually
  any platform and does not violate any privacy rules

Besides its active involvement in building a public database about Lebanon, LebData is also
increasingly dedicated to:

- *disseminating knowledge*: LebData provides free, open-access training material
   on its [Resource page](/resources), and is planning to organize workshops about data and public governance. In addition LebData encourages its members to write [data driven articles](/blog).

- *consulting on data governance*: LebData members support interested parties in data governance reforms through consultation with local and international experts.
